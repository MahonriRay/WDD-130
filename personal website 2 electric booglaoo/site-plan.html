      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Bees are essential to mother nature and every day life. Asides from making delicious honey, they help pollinate the flowers and feed which are useful for live stock. As someone who works with websites, I want to create a website that could be easily used as a tool by beekeepers, with the possibility of adding a portion of the website where bee products could be sold. Haven't you ever wondered what beekeepers do? Having a website that doubles up as a tool as well as place to sell product is surely to answer that question as well as move product!</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is those who beekeep and all those who love honey.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        (This will be the home page for my website and include why and what is in my website.)
        People will come to my website to learn about the ins and outs of beekeeping. It will be geared towards those who are just getting into bee keeping as well for those who might have a couple of years of bee keeping under their belt. The idea of my website is to be a central hub of information about bee keeping that will be beneficial for any visitor that may  find themselves on my website.
          “What is Bee Keeping?”  I expect that anyone who visits my website will be able to take away the basics of bee keeping. More specifically I will be providing the information of what exactly it means to keep bees, how to care for them, and what is needed to do so. Adding on, most of those who already keep bees have their reasons for doing so, but my website could also answer why one would want to keep bees. Whether it be for a hobby, to get out and care for something, or for the delicious honey they make my website will have the answer and resources for the why and how.
          Visitors should want to come to my website because as far as I’ve looked online there isn’t a website that fully explains why one would want to bee keep as well as have the resources to help those getting into bee keeping. My website will be a good little central hub to help those just starting out as well for those who already are well into the process of keeping bees.

      </ul>
      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <p>
        (This will be one of the pages that will include tools and any information that will prove beneficial)
        As far as activities, those who visit my website will be able to interact with tools such as pollen count, a weather report for the area they are in, and so on and so forth.  These resources will be valuable to have in a singular place rather than in an assortment of other places. Other resources might include guides on how to arrange beehives, common problems others have faced, and how to care for the actual bees of the hive.

      <h3>Guide</h3>
      <p>
        This will be the final page to my website and have guides and any other tool that will give direction to those visiting my website.)
	Most information will be provided and you won’t need to be an expert on beekeeping to find my website valuable. This website isn’t for everyone, but more so for everyone who wants to bee keep or is already in the process of doing so. I guess by that metric, the only information one would need in order to interact with my website and gain the most out of it is to know whether or not they want to bee keep. That doesn’t even have to be certain as my website also explain why one would want to bee keep!
