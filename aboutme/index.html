    <h2>Mahonri "Mo" Ray</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Mahonri Ray, you can call me Mo or anything else you'd like. I am a transfer student from the University of Hawai'i where I obtained an Associate's Degree in Audio Engineering.
         I was born in a small town in Arizona called Eagar. Since then, because my father was in the military, I've lived all around the world. Some of the places I've lived are California, Egypt, Germany, Iowa, Illinois and Hawai'i. Before coming to BYU-I I spent about a year living in Mesa, Arizona.</p>
    <p>I really love music and doing activities outdoors. You'll more than likely find me skateboarding when I have free time, or on my way to snowboard or surf. 
        I am also into playing video games as well. Rainbow Six Siege and Apex Legends are the games I play most at the moment, if you're trying to run some games, let me know!</p>
    <p>I've only been at BYU-I for roughly a week now, but one of the things I love most about this place might be the beautful gardens or the calm nature of the campus.</p>
